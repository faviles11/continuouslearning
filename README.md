# Questions & Answers on Microservices, Docker, and Kubernetes (IKS)

## üß© Microservices

### 1. What is a microservice and how does it differ from a monolithic architecture?

**Answer:**  
A microservice is an independent and loosely coupled service. Unlike monolithic architecture, which typically has 2 or 3 layers, microservices are composed of many isolated layers, providing better system stability and decoupling dependencies.  
**Feedback:**  
Good. You can also mention that microservices allow independent deployment, scaling, and maintenance, unlike monoliths.

### 2. What is IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service (IKS) and what are its benefits for deploying microservices?

**Answer:**  
It's a Kubernetes-as-a-Service platform that lets you use Kubernetes clusters without managing the physical infrastructure.  
**Feedback:**  
Correct. Also mention that IKS manages the control plane, simplifying operations and allowing focus on workloads.

### 3. What minimal components are needed to deploy a microservice in IKS?

**Answer:**  
Computational resources like containers running in pods. Could be serverless as well. Application layer + multiple service layers. Load Balancers or traffic rules can be included.  
**Feedback:**  
Correct idea but scattered. Ideally, mention: `container`, `pod`, `service`, `deployment`, `namespace`. Optionally `Storage` and `ConfigMaps`.

### 4. How can you scale a microservice in IKS?

**Answer:**  
Using dynamic scaling rules.  
**Feedback:**  
Correct, though Azure was referenced. In IKS, use `Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)` and `Cluster Autoscaler`.

### 5. What is the role of pods and services in Kubernetes?

**Answer:**  
Pods run applications or microservices. Services expose those pods internally or externally.  
**Feedback:**  
Clearly and correctly explained.

### 6. How is service discovery managed between microservices deployed in IKS?

**Answer:**  
(Not answered)  
**Feedback:**  
Managed via Kubernetes' internal DNS. Services are discoverable by name within the cluster.

### 7. What strategies can you use for CI/CD deployment of microservices in IKS?

**Answer:**  
Integrate external tools like Azure DevOps and YAML pipelines.  
**Feedback:**  
Good. IKS also supports Jenkins, Tekton, GitHub Actions, or IBM Toolchain.

### 8. How is data persistence managed in a microservices architecture on IKS?

**Answer:**  
Using Persistent Volumes.  
**Feedback:**  
Correct. PVs backed by IBM Block/File Storage are mounted via PVCs.

### 9. What methods exist to secure communication between microservices in an IKS cluster?

**Answer:**  
Expose services using ClusterIP.  
**Feedback:**  
Incomplete. Use Network Policies, mTLS, and service meshes like Istio.

### 10. What‚Äôs the difference between an Ingress Controller and a Load Balancer in IKS?

**Answer:**  
(Not answered)  
**Feedback:**  
`LoadBalancer`: exposes a service with a public IP.  
`Ingress Controller`: routes multiple HTTP/S services via one public IP using rules.

### 11. How do you implement observability (logs, metrics, tracing) for microservices in IKS?

**Answer:**  
With sidecar containers to monitor performance.  
**Feedback:**  
Correct. Use Prometheus, Grafana, Fluentd, LogDNA, Jaeger, Instana in IKS.

### 12. What service mesh tools (like Istio) are compatible with IKS and how do they help?

**Answer:**  
(Not answered)  
**Feedback:**  
Istio, Linkerd, Open Service Mesh. Provide mTLS, tracing, retries, traffic shaping, etc.

### 13. How do you handle resilience (e.g., circuit breakers, retries, timeouts) in IKS microservices?

**Answer:**  
Using proactive/reactive monitoring and ITIL methodology.  
**Feedback:**  
Good overall. Also mention probes, retries, Service Mesh, PodDisruptionBudgets.

### 14. How can you enforce network-level security policies between microservices in IKS?

**Answer:**  
(Not answered)  
**Feedback:**  
With Network Policies, PodSecurityPolicies, and tools like OPA/Gatekeeper.

### 15. How do you optimize resource usage in IKS with different microservice workloads?

**Answer:**  
Dynamic Scaling with multiple app instances.  
**Feedback:**  
Correct. Also use HPA, Cluster Autoscaler, pod affinity/anti-affinity, QoS classes, resource requests/limits.

## üê≥ Docker Questions

1. **Difference between volume and bind mount:**

   - Volume: managed by Docker, stored under `/var/lib/docker/volumes`, great for persistence.
   - Bind mount: links a host path to the container, offering flexibility but less isolation.

2. **Where are Docker volumes stored by default?**

   - `/var/lib/docker/volumes/`

3. **How to share data between containers using volumes?**

   - Mount the same volume in multiple containers.

4. **What happens to a volume if you remove its container?**

   - The volume persists unless explicitly removed with `docker volume rm`.

5. **Can you mount a volume into a running container?**

   - No, volumes must be mounted at container start.

6. **What is a tmpfs mount and when would you use it?**

   - RAM-based storage. Use for temporary or sensitive data.

7. **How to persist a MySQL database using volumes?**

   ```bash
   docker run -v mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql mysql
   ```

8. **Common Docker volume commands:**
   - Create: `docker volume create myvolume`
   - List: `docker volume ls`
   - Inspect: `docker volume inspect myvolume`
   - Remove: `docker volume rm myvolume`

## ‚ò∏Ô∏è Kubernetes Questions

1. **What is a Persistent Volume (PV) and Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)?**

   - PV is the storage resource. PVC is the pod‚Äôs request for storage. It's an abstraction between the pod and backend.

2. **Difference between emptyDir, hostPath, and NFS:**

   - `emptyDir`: temporary storage for a pod.
   - `hostPath`: maps a node's path.
   - `NFS`: shared file system over network.

3. **Types of `accessModes`:**

   - `ReadWriteOnce`, `ReadOnlyMany`, `ReadWriteMany`

4. **Typical flow to mount persistent storage in a pod:**

   - Create a PVC ‚Üí Declare it in the pod.

5. **What is a StorageClass and its role in dynamic provisioning?**

   - Defines how to provision volumes dynamically with specific backends (e.g., IBM Block Storage).

6. **What happens when you delete a pod or PVC?**

   - PVC may be deleted; PV remains depending on reclaim policy (`Retain`, `Recycle`, `Delete`).

7. **How to share a volume between multiple pods?**

   - Use a volume with `ReadWriteMany` access mode and mount it in all pods.

8. **Difference between static and dynamic provisioning:**

   - Static: manually create PV.
   - Dynamic: PV created automatically when PVC requests it via StorageClass.

9. **What storage backends are compatible with Kubernetes?**

   - NFS, AWS EBS, Azure Disk, GCE PD, IBM Block/File Storage, CSI drivers.

10. **What if multiple pods access a volume with ReadWriteOnce mode?**

- Only one pod can mount it with write access. Others will fail if on different nodes.

11. **What is CSI (Container Storage Interface)?**

- A standard for storage vendors to build Kubernetes-compatible plugins.

12. **Can you mount a PVC in an initContainer? Why?**

- Yes, to prepare data before the main container runs (e.g., download or unzip files).

13. **How to use snapshots/backups of volumes in Kubernetes?**

- Using CSI `VolumeSnapshots` for create/restore/management.

14. **How to migrate data between clusters using persistent volumes?**

- Backup the PV and restore in the new cluster, or use storage replication tools.

  labels:
    app: my-application
